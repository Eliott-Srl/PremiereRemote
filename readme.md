# PremiereRemote - Customizable remote access to Adobe Premiere Pro CEP.

## Explaination

This is the scripts I use daily for my editings. I use autohotkey to launch the functions with curl
```autohotkey
F11::
	Run curl ""http://localhost:8081/yourFunction?param1=Hello&param2=World"",,hide
	return
```
It's a symbiosis between the Premiere Pro API and autohotkey scripts. It allows me to perform very complex functions with great speed, thus exponentially improving my editing efficiency.It's a symbiosis between the Premiere Pro API and autohotkey scripts.
